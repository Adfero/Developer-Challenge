# Front End Developer Candidate Test

Write a todo list web application that does the following:

1. Allows the user to add and complete todos in a dynamic, single-page app.
2. Use a front-end MVC framework.
3. Use Bootstrap or Foundation libraries as the baseline CSS.
4. Store the user's todo data using the browser's local storage or a hosted backend such as Firebase.
5. Build a chart displaying user activity with regard to addition and completion of todos over a series of time.

To create this application, you should make use of either the Angular or Backbone MVC libraries. Use whatever storage method you prefer. Please share the code with us via a GitHub link.
