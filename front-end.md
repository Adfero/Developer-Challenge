# Front End Developer Candidate Test

Write a time tracking web application that does the following:

1. Allows the user to add time spent on various projects and associate that time with a date.
2. Use a front-end MVC framework.
3. Use Bootstrap or Foundation libraries as the baseline CSS.
4. Store the user's time data using the browser's local storage or a hosted backend such as Firebase.
5. Build a chart displaying user activity with regard to time spent on projects over a series of days.

To create this application, you should make use of either the Angular or Backbone MVC libraries. Use whatever storage method you prefer. Please share the code with us via a GitHub link.
