# Drupal Developer Candidate Test

Create a Drupal module which does the following:

1. Displays a page to any user (anonymous or authenticated) with a form.
2. Collect a few pieces of basic information using this form and save it to the MySQL database. (This data can be fields such as first name, last name, state, gender, etc)
3. Create an admin-only page that displays the results of those form submissions in a table and in another visual format of your choice. (Be creative!)

To create this module, you should make use of the Drupal Forms, Schema, and Permission APIs. Please share the code with us via email or GitHub link.
