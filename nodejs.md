# Node.js Developer Candidate Test

Write a "Metro Trip Planner" application in Node.js that does the following:

1. Allows login to a restricted section using social media accounts.
2. Stores basic user data in a database.
3. Accepts start and end station and time input via an AJAX form.
4. Fetch schedule data from the [WMATA API](https://developer.wmata.com).
5. Display recommended Metro trip to user.
6. Store recommended trips for user and display in a "My Trips" interface.

To create this application, you should make use of the Express and Passport packages. Use whatever database - NoSQL or SQL - you prefer. Please share the code with us via a GitHub link.
