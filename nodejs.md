# Node.js Developer Candidate Test

Create a Node.js driven application that does the following:

1. Allows login to a restricted section using social media accounts.
2. Stores basic user data in a database.
3. Accepts input via an AJAX form.
4. Prints records from the database that user has submitted in a data table.
5. Fetch data from a third-party API and integrate it with the user experience.

To create this application, you should make use of the Express and Passport packages. Use whatever database - NoSQL or SQL - you prefer. Please share the code with us via a GitHub link.
